# Fuzzy search

Provides a fuzzy search using the quick pick window of the current text
document.

Bind `fuzzySearch.activeTextEditor` to a keyboard shortcut to use the search
quickly.

Support `fuzzySearch.withPredefinedSearchArg` to pass a predefined search which can be combined with the `macro-commander` extension.
